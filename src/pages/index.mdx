## Abstract

Deploying deep learning (DL) models for point-of-care ul-
trasound (POCUS) requires real-time identification of out-of-distribution
(OOD) images to enable safe and confident prediction vs. deferral to clin-
icians where distribution shifts are large. However, the lack of standard-
ized benchmarks has hindered the evaluation of OOD detection meth-
ods in POCUS. To address this, we introduce HocusPOCUS, a bench-
mark comprising real and simulated data capturing realistic POCUS
shifts: unseen anatomical views, scanner-specific artifacts, image quality
variations, and speckle noise. We demonstrate the utility of this bench-
mark using a post-hoc OOD detection method, Maximum Logit Score
(MLS), with the HocusPOCUS dataset. To do this, we train view clas-
sifiers for the adult knee, maternal-fetal, and pediatric renal ultrasound
and use MLS to jointly detect unseen anatomical views (semantic shift)
and model failure under covariate shift on HocusPOCUS datasets and
held-out datasets. Our experiments reveal critical limitations in MLS
for POCUS. 1. Bias Amplification: MLS disproportionately flags un-
derrepresented classes and severe disease cases as OOD, perpetuating
existing model biases. 2. Artifact Sensitivity: Scanner-specific back-
grounds and foreground shape can artificially inflate OOD scores, leading
to spurious detections. 3. Shift Ambiguity: Failed OOD detection is
not easily distinguishable between unseen anatomical views (semantic
shifts) or severe covariate shifts, complicating failure diagnosis in prac-
tice. 4. Temporal Instability: High variability in frame-level OOD
scores undermines reliability in real-time video applications. These find-
ings highlight the need for domain-specific OOD detection frameworks
that mitigate covariate shift sensitivity, improve semantic shift detection,
and integrate temporal context. By addressing these challenges, OOD de-
tection can enhance the reliability of POCUS DL systems in dynamic,
real-world settings.
